### 2.4 Vendor Analytics Engine

**Scoring Methodology**
```
Lending Score = (Posting Frequency × 0.3) + 
                (Average Views × 0.4) + 
                (Price Consistency × 0.2) + 
                (Engagement Rate × 0.1)
```

**Risk Classification**
- **High Priority (≥70)**: Ready for micro-lending
- **Medium Priority (40-69)**: Additional assessment required
- **Low Priority (<40)**: High risk, not recommended
